# Binary Search Tree in C++

This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) along with custom Stack and Queue data structures. The BST allows you to perform operations like insertion, deletion, search, and traversal. The Stack and Queue implementations are included as well.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

The `BinarySearchTree` class represents a binary search tree and provides several functionalities:

- Key search
- Insertion of elements
- Deletion of elements
- Printing the tree structure
- Counting the number of nodes
- Finding the height of the tree
- In-order traversal (iterative and recursive)
- Level-order traversal
- Checking if two trees are similar
- Checking if two trees have identical keys

## Stack

The `Stack` and `StackArray` classes provide a basic stack data structure for elements of any data type. It includes:

- Pushing elements onto the stack
- Popping elements from the stack
- Checking if the stack is empty
- Handling stack overflow and underflow

## Queue

The `Queue` and `QueueArray` classes provide a basic queue data structure for elements of any data type. It includes:

- Enqueuing elements into the queue
- Dequeuing elements from the queue
- Checking if the queue is empty
- Handling queue overflow and underflow


## Examples
The main.cpp file contains example code that demonstrates the usage of the Binary Search Tree and data structures. 

You can use it as a reference for how to use these data structures in your own projects.
